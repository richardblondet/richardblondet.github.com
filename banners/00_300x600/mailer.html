        <p class="header half">MYTH:</p>
        <p class="title half">Pain is a sure sign of cancer</p>
        <p class="text half">Some cancers never cause pain. And while pain can be a part of life with some forms of cancer, doctors have many ways to manage it.</p>
        <p class="header half">FACT:</p>
        <p class="title half">There's an easy way to prevent cancer.</p>
        <p class="text half">Don't smoke. If you do, quit. Worldwide, smoking causes 22% of all cancer deaths and about 71% of lung cancer deaths. It's the single biggest cause of cancer that you can just say no to.</p>
        <p class="header half">MYTH: </p>
        <p class="title half">Most cancer is inherited.</p>
        <p class="text half">Cancer is caused by changes in your genes, but less than 10% of cancers are inherited. Most cancers are caused by aging and exposure to tobacco smoke and radiation.</p>
        <p class="header">FACT: </p>
        <p class="title">Cell phones don't cause cancer.</p>
        <p class="text">Changes in your genes cause cancer. The low-frequency energy your cell phone puts out doesn't affect your DNA.</p>
        <p class="header">MYTH: </p>
        <p class="title">Water bottles cause cancer.</p>
        <p class="text">You can ignore that chain email that says DEHA, a chemical in plastic, causes cancer. The Environmental Protection Agency and leading cancer researchers agree that it doesnt.</p>
        <p class="header">FACT: </p>
        <p class="title">Artificial sweeteners don't cause cancer.</p>
        <p class="text">There's no evidence that any artifical sweetener currently OK'd for sale in the U.S. causes cancer.</p>
